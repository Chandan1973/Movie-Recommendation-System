# Movie Recommendation System
Overview
This Movie Recommendation System leverages advanced content-based filtering and machine learning techniques to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences. Built with Python, pandas, and scikit-learn, the project demonstrates modular data processing, efficient feature engineering, and robust recommendation logic ideally suited for educational and production-scale environments alike.

Key Features
Content-Based Filtering:
Utilizes genres, cast, crew, and keyword metadata to compute similarity scores and deliver tailored recommendations using cosine similarity on TF-IDF vectorized features.

Data-Driven Insights:
Processes and analyzes large-scale movie datasets to extract actionable insights, handle missing data, and enable extensible feature integration for improved accuracy.

Customizable & Extensible Pipeline:
Designed for rapid experimentation—add new content features or swap out vectorization/model components as needed to match business use cases.

Reproducibility & Clarity:
Includes well-structured, fully annotated code to ensure transparency and facilitate onboarding for collaborators or stakeholders.

Getting Started
Dependencies:

Python 3.x

pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, difflib

(See the “Importing dependencies” cell in the notebook for precise requirements.)

How to Run:

Open the Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.

Upload your movie metadata CSV (e.g., movies.csv) to the session or file directory.

Follow the notebook sequentially—from preprocessing to recommendation generation.

Adjust selected_features or input fields to experiment with different similarity strategies.

Personalization:

Users can input custom movie titles to receive curated recommendations.

Easily enhance the underlying similarity metric by incorporating additional features or alternate recommendation algorithms.

Project Structure
